		<img src="img/asia2.jpg">
		<p>My name is Asia Lee.
		I was born in Chicago and raised some of my life in Madison I am 17, and I will be a Senior at LaFollette High school.
		I came into the whole Maydm program not the tech-savy type, and I'm still not.
		I've learned more and more each time I attend these programs, and hopefully it takes a toll in my future.
		I'm an Artist, I like to sing and cook. I have a big family, and I like to consider myself the royal one out of the bunch.
		After I graduate I want to go more onto a path where I can help kids. I want to open my own art studio in Chicago where artistic kids in any field of art
		 (music, dancing, fashion, etc) can go to be safe and express their talents.
		I want to give them the push they either can't get or don't have yet to help them suceed in life.

		<h2>Sadie</h2>
		<img src="img/sadie.jpg">
		<p>My name is Sadie McCaulley. I am 15 years old.
		I was born in Madison, WI and raised in a small suburb called McFarland; where I attend high school and am currently a sophmore. In my free time I enjoy distance running, eating ice cream, watching Gilmore Girls, playing violin, coding, and reading. I am passionate about computer science and careers in tech because of the creativity involved, the problem-solving and hard work required, as well as the endless applications and career paths. Maydm has exposed me to so many new ideas and opportunities, and this 3 week course has helped me to take on the identity of a "developer"
		(thanks Sam) and build confidence in my future.

		<h2>Lily</h2>
		<img src="img/lily.jpg">
		<p>"My name is Lillie Newson, and I am 15 years old.
		I was born in Madison, WI, and will soon be a sophmore at La Follette High School.
		As a kid, I grew up having technology in the house, and always loved to watch relatives play video games,
		until I could finally do it myself. From there,
		I slowly started to love video games, and reading/writing on the side.
		When I got older, I finally realized that I could make my passion into a career, and I had the creative/social skills to do it.
		I decided to sign up for Maydm because I wanted to build on my coding knowledge before college so I could have a foothold in what I want to do.
		My personality is built off of humor, but I don't always talk much, and my humor doesn't always mesh well with other people.
		I'm also very independent and love meeting new people. My other large hobby is music.
		I'm in concert/pep/marching band, play the tuba and ukulele primarily, and hope to make music electronically someday."

		<img  src="img/james3.jpg">
		<P>James Manly I am a human, I do human things.
		I enjoy being human, sometimes I wonder what if I was human.
		I then realize that is a useless thought because I am human so why bother thinking about if I wasn't.
		Being a human is great I breath air, I drink liquids, I eat edible solids, so life is good.
		As a human I also sleep regularly and work out so I don't get heath issues.
		I hope you, as fellow humans, understand where I'm coming from. As a human I also have hobbies, this includes, but isn't limited to: listening to music
		Sleeping, Working out, Eating food, Drinking fluids
		And being a human.
		I am most definitely a human, I act human I look human, I taste human, I even smell human.

							<p>The earliest attempt to build an electronic computer was by J. V. Atanasoff, a professor of physics and mathematics at Iowa State, in 1937. He wanted to help his graduate students solve systems of partial differential equations. By 1941 he and graduate student Clifford Berry had succeeded in building a machine that could solve 29 simultaneous equations with 29 unknowns, but it wasnâ€™t programmable.</p>

						<p>A second early electronic machine was Colossus, designed by Alan Turing for the British military in 1943. This machine played an important role in breaking codes used by the German army in World War II. The existence of Colossus was kept secret until long after the war ended, and the credit due to Turing and his colleagues for designing one of the first working electronic computers was slow in coming. Grace Hopper was an important military leaders, mathmatician, and computer programmer during WWII. After the war, Hopper remained with the Navy as a reserve officer. As a research fellow at Harvard, she worked with the Mark II and Mark III computers.In 1952, Grace Hopper and her team created the first compiler for computer languages. Grace Hopper became the first female individual recipient of the National Medal of Technology in 1991.  </p>

							<p>The first general purpose programmable electronic computer was the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC), built by J. Presper Eckert and John V. Mauchly at the University of Pennsylvania. Work began in 1943, funded by the Army Ordnance Department, which needed a way to compute ballistics during World War II. The machine wasn't completed until 1945, but then it was used extensively for calculations during the design of the hydrogen bomb.

<p> During this second generation many high level programming languages were introduced. The term ``supercomputer'' is generally reserved for a machine that is an order of magnitude more powerful than other machines of its era. Two machines of the 1950s deserve this title. The Livermore Atomic Research Computer (LARC) and the IBM 7030 (aka Stretch) were early examples of machines that overlapped memory operations with processor operations and had primitive forms of parallel processing.

				<p> Electronic switches in this era were based on discrete diode and transistor technology with a switching time of approximately 0.3 microseconds. The first machines to be built with this technology include TRADIC at Bell Laboratories in 1954 and TX-0 at MIT's Lincoln Laboratory.

						<p>In 1964, Seymour Cray developed the CDC 6600, which was the first architecture to use functional parallelism. By using only 10 separate functional units that could operate simultaneously and 32 independent memory banks, the CDC 6600 was able to attain a computation rate of 1 million floating point operations per second (1 Mflops).
The IBM 360/91, which was released during the same period as the CDC 660, was roughly twice as fast. It employed instruction, looked ahead, separated the floating point and integer functional units and pipelined instruction stream.
the Department of Defense and the University of Illinois, were representative of the first parallel computers. The Texas Instrument Advanced Scientific Computer (TI-ASC) and the STAR-100 of CDC were pipelined vector processors that demonstrated the viability of that design and set the standards for subsequent vector processors.
Martin Richards of Cambridge developed a subset of CPL called BCPL (Basic Computer Programming Language, 1967). In 1970 Ken Thompson of Bell Labs developed yet another simplification of CPL called simply B, in connection with an early implementation of the UNIX operating system.</p>

						<p>During this time, high speed vector processors, such as the CRAY 1, CRAY X-MP and CYBER 205 dominated the high performance computing scene.
Developments in software include high level languages like FP (functional programming) and Prolog (programming in logic). These languages use a declarative programming style as opposed to the imperative style of Pascal, C, FORTRAN, et al. In a declarative style, a programmer gives a mathematical specification of what should be computed, leaving many details of how it should be computed to the compiler and/or runtime system.
The few languages they have are not used world wide yet. Only few places use the languages.


The Lax Report said that aggressive and focused foreign initiatives in high performance computing, especially in Japan, were in sharp contrast to the absence of coordinated national attention in the United States. The report noted that university researchers had inadequate access to high performance computers.</p>

						<p>  The development of the next generation of computer systems is characterized mainly by the acceptance of parallel processing. Until this time parallelism was limited to pipelining and vector processing, or at most to a few processors sharing jobs. The fifth generation saw the introduction of machines with hundreds of processors that could all be working on different parts of a single program. The scale of integration in semiconductors continued at an incredible pace - by 1990 it was possible to build chips with a million components - and semiconductor memories became standard on all computers.

						<p> Many of the developments in computer systems since 1990 reflect gradual improvements over established systems, and thus it is hard to claim they represent a transition to a new ``generation'', but other developments will prove to be significant changes.</p>

						<p>The federal commitment to high performance computing has been further strengthened with the passage of two particularly significant pieces of legislation: the High Performance Computing Act of 1991, which established the High Performance Computing and Communication Program (HPCCP) and Sen. Gore's Information Infrastructure and Technology Act of 1992, which addresses a broad spectrum of issues ranging from high performance computing to expanded network access and the necessity to make leading edge technologies available to educators from kindergarten through graduate school. <a href="http://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/12784/what-year-is-star-trek-the-original-series-set-in" target="_blank"></a> </p>

						<p>In today's high performance computing environment, a computational scientist's routine activities rely heavily on the Internet. Activities include exchange of e-mail and interactive talk or chat sessions with colleagues. Heavy use is made of the ability to transfer documents such as proposals, technical papers, data sets, computer programs and images. A networked high performance computing environment provides the computational scientist access to a wide array of computer architectures and applications. Using telnet to connect to a remote computer (on which one has an account) on the Internet enables the computational scientist to use all of the computational power and software applications of that remote machine.</p>

						<p>From June 26th until July 14th, a group of high schoolers (learn more on the "About Us" page) got together at 100State for learning and exploring technology. We were led by Samantha Burbol and Rachel Reiter and were paired with mentors in technology in the Madison area. </p>

						<p>Along with developing this website, we did activities with our mentors, created digital resumes, learned and practiced coding, and explored CS and IP. <a href="http://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/12784/what-year-is-star-trek-the-original-series-set-in" target="_blank"></a> </p>

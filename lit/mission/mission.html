		<!-- insert content - paragraph on mission & sources listed below-->
<p><b>We are some random high schoolers who just so happen to like technology and got together under one roof. Our mission is to become developers over time during this summer technology course.
	As a team, the Leaders In Technology (LIT) created this website with the help of our wonderful mentors and teachers just to show you what we've learned and what we can do. A lot of us have only
	 had little bits of experience through Maydm, and others of us do this for a living and have lots of experiance. With the motivation and inspiration of eachother we worked hard, got it done, and enjoyed our time doing it.</b> </p>
